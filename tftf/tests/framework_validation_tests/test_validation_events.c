 * @Test_Aim@ Validate the events API
 *
 * This test exercises the events API.
 * - It creates a sequence of events sending and receiving. The order of
 *   operations is ensured by synchronizing at strategic points.
 * - It tests the communication in both directions (i.e. from CPUx to CPUy and
 *   vice versa).
 * - It tests that it doesn't matter whether CPUx waits for the event first
 *   then CPUy sends the event, or that things happen in the other order.
 * - It tests the API on a single CPU.
 *
 * This test is skipped if an error occurs during the bring-up of non-lead CPUs.
 * Otherwise, this test always returns success. If something goes wrong, the
 * test will most probably hang because the system will go into a WFE/SEV dead
 * lock.
