The Trusted Firmware-A Tests (TF-A-Tests) is a suite of baremetal tests to
exercise the `Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A)`_ features from the Normal World. It
enables strong TF-A functional testing without dependency on a Rich OS. It
mainly interacts with TF-A through its SMC interface.

It provides a basis for TF-A developers to validate their own platform ports and
add their own test cases.
